## Install

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Compiles and minifies for production, this will also build the Swagger UI (api.html):
```
npm run build
```

## Development Server

Compiles and hot-reloads for development:
```
npm run serve
```

Note: The build for the development server does not support switching themes. This can be enabled by setting
`devModeThemes` to `true` in `vue.config.js`. This will however disable CSS reloading.

## Style Guide

- Use 4 spaces for indenting please.
- The maximum line length should not exceed 120 characters.

## OpenAPI Client

The JavaScript OpenAPI client for the backend API is generated based on the `web/frontend-api.json` file 
that is generated by the backend.

```
./openapi.sh

cd neucore-js-client
npm install
npm run build
```

## Console Commands

### ESI routes

The UI for ESI requests requires a list of all ESI GET and POST routes. This list can be regenerated with:

```
bin/esi-paths.js
```
